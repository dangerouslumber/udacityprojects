      <h1> Stage 0: Getting started with HTML</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>
          The internet is a collection of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents. HTML is the language that breowers your to decipher web pages. These different pages are connected with hyperlinks which create the <em>web</em> in the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web is made up of 4 main components:
          <ul>
            <li>Browsers - programs that run on your computer to display HTML files</li>
            <li>Internet - a vast network of computers</li>
            <li>Servers - computers that host files that make up the web</li>
            <li>HTTP - The main protocol of the web that browsers use to communicate with servers</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>HMTL Basics</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong> determines what you see on a website, what it looks like, and includes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Links</a> to other pages and references to other documents.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Markup, Tags, all good things</h2>
        <p>
          Markup is made up of tags and follow the pattern of <em>opening tag</em> <strong>contents</strong> <em>closing tag</em>. With these tags you can <em>emphasize</em> text or <b>embolden</b> it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to remember to end tags, because you could want <b>this</b> but end up with <b>that instead.</b> When writing code, remember that computers rely on specific instructions. Even small errors - like forgetting an end tag - can result in problems.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>HTML Documents</h2>
        When creating a HTML document, you need the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Doctype</li>
          <li>HTML tags at the beginning and end of the document</li>
          <li>Head tag - contains the title, CSS, metadata, and other pieces</li>
          <li>Body tag - the contents of the document</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

        <h2>Why CSS and HTML and how to think about them</h2>
        <p>
          Front-end development is a great place to begin learning. Students are able to receive immediate and visual feedback of their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          When developers are given a mock-up of a design, they have to translate a visual into an actual website. One way to think about the makeup of a site is to compare it to a house. HTML is the walls of the house, CSS is the interior design and style, and Java Script is the interactive features of the house.
        </p>

        <h2>HTML - CSS - DOM</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is a language with snytax and rules and made up of tags. These tags are turned into elements in a tree by DOM - which is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML. CSS determines the styling of the HTML - font, color, size, etc.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Boxes, Grids, and Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Website designs are based on boxes, and when creating a site from a visual, it is critical to unpack a design with boxes. <strong>Div</strong> tags help build boxes on sites and structure design.
